# Component_Cohesion

First of all, I used the package "Human" as a main group, and then divided that package into 2 packages called "Student" and "Teacher", because a human can be a student or a teacher or whatever else. It's a fact that every student and teacher has a name, which demostrates their self-indentity, but I added the "age" object to the "Teacher" class to show that it does not affect the package "Student" and its classes. Next, as there are many universities for students and jobs for educators, I have created several classes and each of them has their own features. Instead of calling every import of a class, I simply can use "import Human.Student.*;", which is related to the reuse/release equivalence principle. According to the second principle, it's was written that we can change something in a class of some package, for instance by adding a function with int "age" parameter in the "Teacher" class, without changing other classes of a different components or we can make a student change their university, in my case, i only allowed to change the university for AITU students to become KBTU students, but it does not affect ENU students. And the last principle says that we don't need to use the things, which are not neccessary for us (we don't need to use unrelatable objects in 1 package from the other component), which can be seen in my project, where information from a "Student " package like change university or name of a student is unneccessary to the "Teacher" package, because teacher does not need a name of a student or change the university. So that's why i collected the relatable information to the packages accordingly(information about students to the "Student" package and about teachers to the "Teacher" component, but both of them are in the main component called "Human", beause a student and a teacher are humans).
